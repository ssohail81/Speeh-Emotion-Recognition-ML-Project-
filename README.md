# Speeh-Emotion-Recognition-ML-Project-
This project explores the detection of human emotions from speech using Machine Learning (ML). Leveraging audio features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), pitch, and energy, the model classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and neutrality from speech samples.
